DIRECTIONS: Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will 
need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea... make sure that you provide adequate 
explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

NOTE: The "Business Problem" portion is in a separate file.

DATA: This analysis will use venue information directly from FourSquare, as well as location coordinates from
Nominatim. The following Colorado cities will be examined: Denver, Aurora, Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Fort Collins, 
Lakewood, Thornton, Arvada, Westminster, and Centennial. Only venues that fall under the "Medical Center" category 
(ID "4bf58dd8d48988d104941735") will be included. Note that this category includes multiple sub-categories, 
such as "Hospital", "Emergency Room", and "Urgent Care". Within each city, the data will be massaged to find the 
count of nearby facilities of each type of sub-category.

First, latitude and longitude values will be retrieved via Nominatim. Then, a FourSquare URL request will be used with 
each city's latitude and longitude, to get the maximum venue records (50 for free accounts) for venues with a 
categoryID of "4bf58dd8d48988d104941735". Given each venue record, the counts of each category sub-type within a city 
will be computed. A visualization of the results will be created, to assist the target audience in their decision.
For instance, someone that knows they want to work in an emergency room would give preference to those cities with the 
highest count of venues in the "Emergency Room" category.
